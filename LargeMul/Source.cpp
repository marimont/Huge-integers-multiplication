/*I've implemented this program to solve another program. I've been asked to write a multithreading program performing some 
mathematical operations on a set of input data passed through a binary file to the main function. One of the threads was supposed
to compute, for each input number, the overall product of the numbers received by that time.

I realized that, by simply passing a set of numbers which progressively grew from 1 to something more than 20  (even 21) I was 
not able to represent the result of the multiplication even on a LONGLONG data type (which is the biggest available).

So, I've decided to implement a digit by digit multiplication which basically simply applies the multiplication algorithm and 
saves each digit in a cell of an array. The result is then printed out, by scanning the array.

The program is not optimized, since I wrote it in a kind of hurry and there could be some mistakes. Moreover, it is implemented
in a way which is somehow functional to my initial assignment. But, the important thing is the algorithm I've used, which, 
I think could be interesting.
